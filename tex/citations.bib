The rapid development of information and communication technology has enabled organisations to change the way they operate, interact with customers, and compete in the market. This research aims to analyse the impact of digital transformation on business models and competitive advantage. This research is a literature review that uses a qualitative approach, which implies that data will be analysed and interpreted using information and text obtained from various sources. The study results show that in the ongoing era of digital transformation, its impact on business models and competitive advantage is an aspect that cannot be ignored. This digital transformation has changed the fundamentals of how organisations operate and interact with customers, and how they can win the competition in an increasingly fierce market. Digital transformation has brought about a significant business paradigm shift. Today, more organisations are integrating digital technology as an integral part of their business model. It is no longer an option, but a necessity to maintain relevance and competitiveness in the market.},

	abstract = {Software-enabled technologies and urban big data have become essential to the functioning of cities. Consequently, urban operational governance and city services are becoming highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism that is the key mode of production for smart cities. At the heart of data-driven urbanism is a computational understanding of city systems that reduces urban life to logic and calculative rules and procedures, which is underpinned by an instrumental rationality and realist epistemology. This rationality and epistemology are informed by and sustains urban science and urban informatics, which seek to make cities more knowable and controllable. This paper examines the forms, practices and ethics of smart cities and urban science, paying particular attention to: instrumental rationality and realist epistemology; privacy, datafication, dataveillance and geosurveillance; and data uses, such as social sorting and anticipatory governance. It argues that smart city initiatives and urban science need to be re-cast in three ways: a re-orientation in how cities are conceived; a reconfiguring of the underlying epistemology to openly recognize the contingent and relational nature of urban systems, processes and science; and the adoption of ethical principles designed to realize benefits of smart cities and urban science while reducing pernicious effects.
